/**
 * 2.1
 * Write a test that Counters renders with initial value 0 and displays increment
 * and decrement buttons. This is similar to the first test we wrote in WordChecker component.
 * No interactivity yet, just check the initial render to practice accessing elements
 *
 * ðŸ’¡ Tips:
 * - To access buttons use `getByRole("button", { name: /label/i })`
 * - To access counter's value you can use `getByText(/count: X/i)` query or (alternatively) you
 *   can setup a testId and match by testId

/**
 * 2.2
 * Write a test to check that Counter allows to increment and decrement value.
 * The flow would be: render component, check initail value, click increment or
 * decrement buttons and check that the value is correct afterwards
 *
 * You may create `setup` helper function as we did in the example with WordChecker
 *
 * ðŸ’¡ Tips:
 * - To click on a button use `await user.click(button)`, but don't forget to use
 *   userEvent.setup() first
 * - Don't forget to add async to your test function (same as we did in the example)

 *
 * If you have additional time, make sure Counter component displays alert message
 * when count is out of range
 *
 * Example:
 * <Counter min={5} max={12} />
 *
 * ðŸ’¡ Tips:
 * - To check if button is disabled use `toBeDisabled()` matcher
 * - To check if button is enabled use `toBeEnabled()` matcher
