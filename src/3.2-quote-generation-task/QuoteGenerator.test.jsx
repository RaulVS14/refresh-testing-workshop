 * Write a test that it fetches and displays a random quote

 *
 * ðŸ’¡ Tips:
 * - You can mock the whole `api` module with `jest.mock("./api");`, alternatively you can mock `fetch`
 * - Important to note, that `testing-library` follows ARIA standards and the way they define
 *   [implicit roles](https://www.w3.org/TR/html-aria/#docconformance). Therefore you would see
 *   that there is no "blockquote" role. To get quote contents you can use `getByText` query
 * - To wait until loading finishes you have a few strategies, read more about them
 *   [here](https://testing-library.com/docs/dom-testing-library/api-async#waitfor)

 * Create `mockQuote` function that accepts overrides and returns full object

 * Example:
 * mockQuote({ content: "test" });
 *
 * Then use it in your tests to simplify mocking
